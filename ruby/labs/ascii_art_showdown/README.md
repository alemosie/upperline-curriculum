In this lab, we'll build a game around ascii animal art! In each of the five rounds of the game, we'll randomly select two animals from an assortment of ascii animal art (6 base animals found in `ascii_art.rb`). Then, we'll prompt the user for a vote, and keep track of the score. The animal with the most votes wins!

## Instructions

See the `ascii_showdown_lab.rb` file for line-by-line instructions as comments in the code. The lab comes pre-packaged with defined methods, but beware -- some of the methods (e.g. number of arugments) may not be complete!

## Skills

- String interpolation and manipulation
- Asking for user input (`gets.chomp`)
- Methods with arguments
- Array methods and manipulation (`.length`, `.sample`, `.index`, retrieval by index)

### Sneak peek at...

- Conditionals and control flow
- Looping (`times` loop)

### Advanced

- Creating and reading from modules
- Constants vs mutable (regular) variables
