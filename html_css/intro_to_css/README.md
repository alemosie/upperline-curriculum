## What's CSS?

CSS, Cascading Stylesheets, is another thing found on every single web page. We learned all about HTML in previous lessons, and how to mark up the content of our page, but now it's time to dive into making those pages look good. The way a website looks is vital to the user having a good experience of it. If you navigate to a website that looks like it was built in 1992, you're much less likely to take it seriously. So let's get stylish!

It can help you do things like this:
- Center text using the text-align property
- Modify content placement with margin, padding, and border properties
- Change image size using height and width properties
- Add background colors using the background property
- Change the font of text using font-size font-family and color properties
- Move chunks of content around the page using the float property

Open up the `codealong.html` file to get started!
